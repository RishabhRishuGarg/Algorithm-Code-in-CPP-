/*
You will be given a positive integer N. Your task is to find the number of positive integers K â‰¤ N
such that K is not divisible by any number among the set {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}. 
so now a number which is divisible 2 that are also divisible by 4,6,8,10 
so we need not to check for them
and those numbrers are divisible by 3 al also divisible by 9 
so only we need to check only for 2,3,5,7 

in this solution i first checked How may number are divisible by 2,3,5,7 and then subtracted the 
resultant number from n will give the answer.
